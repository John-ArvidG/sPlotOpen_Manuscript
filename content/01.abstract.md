## Abstract {.page_break_before}


Vegetation provides the foundation of life on Earth.
Assessing biodiversity status and trends in plant communities is therefore critical to understand, quantify and predict the effects of global change on ecosystems.
Here, we present the largest open-access dataset of vegetation plots (i.e. plant species co-occurrence or community composition data) ever released.
It contains information on 91,205 vegetation plots recording the cover or abundance of each vascular plant species that occurs in a plot of a given surface area at the date of the inventory.
Plots were aggregated from 104 local to regional datasets. To improve the representation of Earthâ€™s environmental conditions, plots were resampled from a larger pool of 1.1 million vegetation plots using an environmentally stratified sampling design.
Each vegetation plot comes with data on species composition, environmental information and plant functional traits.  
Our open-access dataset can be used to explore global patterns of diversity at the plant community level, as ground truthing data in remote sensing applications or as a baseline for biodiversity monitoring.
